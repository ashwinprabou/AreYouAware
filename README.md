## Inspiration
Our journey began with personal experiences of uncertainty following car accidents—moments when neither we nor our friends knew how to proceed legally. Recognizing the anxiety and potential for even worse consequences in such situations, we set out to create a solution that brings calm and clarity when it’s needed most.

## What It Does
RightsNow empowers you to quickly and easily get legal advice during stressful moments. Simply submit your legal inquiry, and our AI Legal Advisor, Madz, delivers clear, high-level guidance on your rights and the best actions to take. Whether you’re dealing with immediate concerns or seeking preventative insight, RightsNow is designed to help you navigate tough situations with confidence.

## How We Built It
The backbone of RightsNow is a robust Python backend that leverages the power of OpenAI Whisper and the Gemini API model to process voice memos and transform them into actionable legal insights. On the frontend, a modern React framework ensures a seamless and engaging user experience. This integration of advanced voice transcription and user-friendly design allows you to focus on your situation without worrying about the technology behind it.

## Challenges We Faced
Integrating multiple components—from voice transcription to delivering reliable AI responses—presented significant challenges. Coordinating between the frontend and backend meant that even small components required rigorous QA testing to ensure consistency across the entire platform. These challenges, however, only strengthened our commitment to creating a reliable and intuitive service.

## Accomplishments We’re Proud Of
We’re especially proud of the intuitive UI/UX design of RightsNow. The interface is clean, straightforward, and user-friendly, ensuring that users of any background can easily navigate the platform and understand the instructions provided. The positive feedback on our design reaffirms our belief that simplicity and clarity are key to effective communication.

## What We Learned
Throughout the development process, we deepened our expertise in integrating voice memo functionalities with the Gemini API. Testing the system not only enhanced our technical capabilities but also provided us with valuable insights into handling real-life legal emergencies. These lessons have prepared us to continuously improve and adapt our service in the face of new challenges.

## What’s Next for RightsNow
Our vision for the future is to enhance accessibility and immediacy. We are working towards integrating advanced voice-to-text capabilities so that you can interact with RightsNow as naturally as speaking to an advisor on speed-dial. This next step is part of our ongoing commitment to ensure you have immediate access to legal guidance, precisely when you need it most.
